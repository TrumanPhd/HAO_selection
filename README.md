# HAO_selection
A feature selection method which can be easily used in statistical learning, welcome the test and application with you.
HAO_selection During 2022b, I propose a new feature selection approach when I learn bio-seq analiysis and data mining. I really admire prof. Q zou and his MRMD, as a spohomore and lover of data mining research, this is my commit to feature selection bio-seq test ranging from protien and DNA RNA has equal performance with MRMD while lesser Computing cost but more test is needed, I will appreciate it if you and directly update you test result not only from bio-seq as the first proposer and tanslate the theory into code, this method and theory has not been published yet you can use it for your work or research use, but it is my original work, please mention me when using it
